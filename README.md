This is my first HTML project that will help me put my HTML knowledge into
practice and build my HTML chops. In this project, I will make a simple
website that will link to a few recipes. By the end of the project, I will
have demonstrated how to set up an HTML boilerplate, how to use basic text
elements like pararaphs and headings, how to organize my files and folders,
how to make some lists, and how to add links and images, along with knowing
what attributes to include for some elements.
