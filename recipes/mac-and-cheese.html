        <p class=" text description">Macaroni and cheese (also called mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) 
            is a dish of macaroni and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar sauce.</p>
        
        <h2 class="header sub">Ingredients</h2>       
        <ul class=" text ingredients">
            <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>¼ onion, minced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>¼ pound processed cheese food</li>
            <li>¼ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>¼ pound shredded Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="header sub">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="text steps">
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong class="strong">350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</strong></li>
            <li>Prepare the elbow macaroni according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in the flour until a cream colored paste forms. 
                Then pour in the milk and stir constantly until this comes to a hard boil, then stir for 1 more minute. Remove from heat 
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>When the macaroni is cooked, spread 1/2 of it into the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                Then layer 1/2 of the grated onion, 1/2 of the salt and pepper and 1/2 of each of the cheeses. Repeat this one more time: 
                macaroni, onion, salt and pepper and cheeses, and then pour the reserved white sauce over all. 
                Top off with small pats of butter to taste.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes.</li>
