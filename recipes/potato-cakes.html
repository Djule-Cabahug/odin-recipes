        <p>Potato cake is a name given to various shaped potato dishes around the world, including a patty of hashed potatoes, 
            a fried patty of mashed potato, a fried and battered slice of potato, or a flatbread made with mashed potato and flour. 
            In Northern England and some states in Australia, a thin slice of potato that is battered and deep fried may be called 
            a potato scallop. In Australia and New Zealand, the terms potato cake, potato flip and potato fritter may be used.</p>
